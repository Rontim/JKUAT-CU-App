### 1. Overview

The **JKUAT CU App** is a cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter** using **GetX** for state management. The app is designed to serve the Christian Union community at JKUAT by providing:

- Daily Bible verses
- Updates on upcoming events
- Access to sermon and worship archives
- Profile management
- A section for donations and fundraising

This document outlines the app’s architecture, which follows a **Layer-Based Architecture** using **GetX** to handle state management, routing, and bindings.

---

### 2. Architecture Overview

We follow a **Layer-Based Architecture** pattern, separating the application into three primary layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and user interaction.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for data handling, including API calls and local storage.

This architecture promotes clean code, maintainability, and testability, and makes the app scalable as it grows in complexity.

---

### 3. Layer-Based Architecture

The project is divided into three main layers: **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data**. Each layer has specific responsibilities, which ensures a clean separation of concerns.

#### 1. Presentation Layer

- **Purpose**: Manages everything the user interacts with, such as UI, controllers, bindings, and routes.
- **Components**:
  - **Controllers**: Handle the interaction between the UI and the business logic.
  - **Bindings**: Initialize the controllers when navigating between screens, ensuring proper dependency injection.
  - **Routes**: Manage app navigation, defining how users move between different screens.

**Example Folder Structure**:

```kotlin
lib/
├── presentation/
    ├── controllers/
    ├── pages/
    ├── widgets/
    ├── bindings/
    ├── routes/
```

- **Pages**: Represent individual screens, such as `HomePage` or `ProfilePage`.
- **Widgets**: Reusable components such as custom buttons or cards.
- **Controllers**: Handle UI logic and interact with the domain layer.
- **Bindings**: Manage the initialization of controllers for each screen.
- **Routes**: Define navigation logic for the app.

---

#### 2. Domain Layer

- **Purpose**: Contains the app’s business logic and defines how data flows between the presentation and data layers.
- **Components**:
  - **Entities**: Represent core business models such as `Event`, `Verse`, or `User`.
  - **Use Cases**: Implement the core functionality, such as retrieving daily verses, submitting donations, or fetching events.
  - **Repositories**: Define interfaces for data handling, separating the presentation layer from data sources.

**Example Folder Structure**:

```kotlin
lib/
├── domain/
    ├── entities/
    ├── repositories/
    ├── usecases/
```

- **Entities**: Define the business objects (e.g., `Event`, `Donation`, `Verse`).
- **Use Cases**: Execute specific application actions (e.g., `GetDailyVerse`, `SubmitDonation`).
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data management. The actual implementation lives in the Data Layer.

---

#### 3. Data Layer

- **Purpose**: Handles external data sources (APIs, databases) and provides the data to the domain layer.
- **Components**:
  - **Models**: Define how raw data from APIs is structured.
  - **Repositories**: Provide the actual implementation for the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.
  - **Data Sources**: Handle the specifics of data fetching, including APIs and local storage.

**Example Folder Structure**:

```kotlin
lib/
├── data/
    ├── models/
    ├── repositories/
    ├── datasources/
```

- **Models**: Represent the structure of external data (e.g., API responses).
- **Repositories**: Concrete implementations of domain-layer interfaces (e.g., `EventRepositoryImpl`).
- **Data Sources**: Manage actual data fetching (e.g., REST API, local storage).

---

### 4. State Management with GetX

We use **GetX** for:

- **Controllers**: To manage state and interact with the domain layer.
- **Bindings**: For dependency injection to initialize controllers when navigating.
- **Routes**: To handle navigation between pages.

#### Controllers

Controllers in GetX manage the state of the UI. For example, an `EventController` would handle logic for fetching upcoming events and updating the UI.

**Example**:

```dart
class EventController extends GetxController {
  final GetUpcomingEvents getUpcomingEvents;
  
  EventController(this.getUpcomingEvents);

  var events = <Event>[].obs;

  void fetchEvents() async {
    final result = await getUpcomingEvents.execute();
    events.assignAll(result);
  }
}
```

#### Bindings

Bindings ensure that the appropriate controllers are initialized when navigating between screens.

**Example**:

```dart
class HomeBinding extends Bindings {
  @override
  void dependencies() {
    Get.lazyPut<EventController>(() => EventController(Get.find()));
  }
}
```

#### Routes

Define routes for navigation between pages, including the binding of controllers.

**Example**:

```dart
final routes = [
  GetPage(
    name: '/home',
    page: () => HomePage(),
    binding: HomeBinding(),
  ),
  GetPage(
    name: '/profile',
    page: () => ProfilePage(),
    binding: ProfileBinding(),
  ),
];
```

### 5. Folder Structure

A typical folder structure for this app might look like:

```kotlin
lib/
│
├── core/
│   ├── constants/
│   ├── errors/
│   ├── exceptions/
│   ├── usecases/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── theme/
│
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── datasources/
│   └── providers/
│
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── usecases/
│   └── value_objects/
│
├── presentation/
│   ├── widgets/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── cubit/
│   ├── bloc/
│   └── routes/
│
├── main.dart
└── app.dart

```

### 6. Explanation of Key Components

- **Entities**: Represent the core data structure used in the domain layer (e.g., `Event`, `Verse`, `Donation`).
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate application logic and execute specific business rules.
- **Repositories**: Interfaces that define data handling, implemented in the Data Layer.
- **Controllers**: Manage the presentation layer, handling user input and coordinating with the domain layer.
- **Bindings**: Inject dependencies for each page.
- **Routes**: Define navigation between screens.

---

### 7. Flow Example: Fetching Upcoming Events

1. The **Presentation Layer** invokes the `EventController` to fetch upcoming events.
2. The **Controller** calls the `GetUpcomingEvents` use case.
3. The **Use Case** interacts with the `EventRepository`, defined in the **Domain Layer**.
4. The **Repository** implementation in the **Data Layer** fetches the events from an API.
5. The **Controller** updates the UI with the retrieved events.

---

### 8. Conclusion

By following the **Layer-Based Architecture** with **GetX**, we ensure that the JKUAT CU App is clean, maintainable, and scalable. Each layer is responsible for a distinct concern, promoting good development practices and ensuring the app can grow and evolve over time.
